 *   * We can more easily test parts of the framework by mocking out container entries instead of

 *   * Support clean injection syntax, i.e. `mailer = service();`.
 *
 * In order to do these, the container must control creating instances of any classes it holds. This
 * allows us to ensure injections are applied to every instance. If you need to create your own
 * instance of a class, you can use the `factoryFor` method which allows you to create your own
 * instance with injections properly applied.
 *
 * However, this should be relatiely rare - most of the time you'll be dealing with objects that
