 * When a request comes in, Denali will invoke the `respond` method (or `respondWith__` for content
 * negotiated requests) on the matching Action class. The return value (or resolved return value) of
 * this method is used to render the response.
 *
 * Actions also support filters. Simply define a method on your action, and add the method name to
 * the `before` or `after` array. Filters behave similar to responders in that they receive the
 * request params and can return a promise which will be waited on before continuing. Filters are
 * inheritable, so child classes will run filters added by parent classes.
